We are the group #2 and we propose HiLo game under programming with classes. 
The main goal in this program is understand the principals of programming with Abstraction, therefore we created a class card, also a class director, in this last one when we developed the workflow of the game based on 5 instances. 
At the end we create a __main__ program that import the Class and the import library used in the program.
